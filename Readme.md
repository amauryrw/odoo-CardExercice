# UI/UX Designer Exercise - Odoo - Amaury Rauw 

In this GitHub repository, I am happy to share Variant A of the UI/UX Designer exercise. It was a real challenge for me, mainly because it was my first time using Bootstrap. I really enjoyed learning it.

This is only Variant A. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to complete the other variants. I plan to keep working with Bootstrap and continue learning it in more detail on my own.

Thank you very much for the opportunity.
